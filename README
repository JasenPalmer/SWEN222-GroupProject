To Run game:

If not executing automatically from a jar file, run "MainMenuWindow.java" in the ui package.
For singleplayer, hit the host button followed by the join button. Leave the IP address blank, enter a name and hit ok.
For multiplayer, playing locally requires one person to host and the others to enter the address of the host computer in the IP field.
To play multiplayer online, the host needs to port forward. As in singleplayer, the host always needs to leave the ip blank.

Using the Editor:

	editted to display the locations in the game.
